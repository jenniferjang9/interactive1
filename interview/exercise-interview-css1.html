        <p><b>what is ‘good’ screen-based design?</p></b><br>
 <p>I believe ‘good’ screen-based design would be  a design that is user friendly. Something that is <a>accessible and easily identifiable.</a> The user should be easily reach what they’re looking for. It should also be visually appealing to keep users interested. A good example would be <a>portal.cca.edu</a> which visually looks better than webadvisor. It’s brighter and easier to read however with the new update, portals tabs make things harder to find because the categories aren’t easily recognizable. Titles such as thriving etc aren’t really useful or necessarily practical.<br><br><br></p>

<p><b>how is art making online different then art making offline?</p></b><br>
<p>Art making offline requires a lot more skill and handiwork as most of analog artwork requires steadiness of the hand or a vast knowledge of skills in order to get certain effects or outcomes. With digital design programs like adobe suite, designers get to easily do things when commands can create the same effect in a second versus a long analog process that can take multiple steps. The handiwork of analog art gives it a different feeling and visual interest because it shows a humans touch whereas digital artwork is usually very perfect.<br><br><br></p>

<p><b>what do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web?</p></b><br>
<p>I believe the web has many purposes which can all vary from menial tasks to drastically important and difficult functions. The web seems like it’s main purpose is function and productivity. Offering everything at the touch of your fingertips from weather updates,  wikipedia, news, media and more. Everything on the web is fast and offers great amount of information and help that’s readily available. Apps and websites advertise products that encourage productivity or enhance ones productivity. Humans like to purchase or use apps that give the facade of a better quality of life.<br><br><br></p>
